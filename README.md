# Reading the Docs

The next two lessons will dig deeper into GraphQL functionalities. You will not finish these lessons with a full grasp of all the material they cover.

That is not the point.

The point of the lessons is to expose you to a wide variety of techniques that are possible with GraphQL. This informs us what is possible, allows us to recognize patterns later on, and reminds us where to go.

Play around with the interactive code examples on the pages to come.

...What are the pages to come?

### The Documentation!

We are getting close to the end of the Power Code Academy. When you are an Apprentice, you will be able to go back and look at previous learn.co lessons. But really, going back to the documentation is the best place to find answers. It sounds obvious as I write it, but it is often forgotten. This is where the term [rtfm](http://www.readthefuckingmanual.com/) comes from. Feel free to google it.
